+ **PubMed** and **Embase** were searched for studies reported prevalence of _H. pylori_ infection among Japanese population (until 30 June, 2016). 

+ 43 papers  &lt;br&gt;
   `\(+\)` JPHC Cohort II &lt;br&gt; 
   `\(+\)` JPHC-NEXT Cohort Study &lt;br&gt;
   included for meta-regression analysis [(Table 1)](http://rpubs.com/winterwang/288338).
+ Prevalence of _H. pylori_ infection reported by birth year group of participants&lt;sup&gt;[1~7]&lt;/sup&gt;.  

]
